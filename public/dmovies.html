<h1>The Best Movies According to David </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Alita: Battle Angel</h3>
<p>My most rewatched among the Top Three. I enjoy this movie. I get goosebumps everytime I see the protagonist awaken to power.</p>
<h3>Old Boy</h3>
<p>This movie sucked me in the first time. I could not stop thinking about how twisted everything turned out. It can feel humbling when you put yourself in the shoes of the victim.</p>
<h3>Jackie Chan's First Strike</h3>
<p>One of my childhood's favorite movies. I had it on VHS and watched it more than once. The action and comedy were so new and fascinating to me as a kid.</p>
